# Jupiter: An Integrated Environment for Automated Negotiators.
Jupiter is a negotiation environment that implements an open architecture for automated negotiators.
It provides a testbed for negotiating agents like Genius.
Genius is a previous work about negotiation environment.
If you have used Genius, it is easy for you to use Jupiter.
But this version has not been adequate to use Jupiter as an alternative to Genius yet.
Jupiter is under development now.

The feature is the following:

- easy for agent developer to use machine learning library
- is able to use agents developed in Genius.
